/**
 * RUO Personality Prototype Classifier
 *
 * Implements the Resilient, Undercontrolled, and Overcontrolled (RUO) personality typology
 * based on Block & Block (1995), Asendorpf et al. (2001), and recent cross-cultural validation
 * studies (Chapman & Goldberg 2011, Specht et al. 2014, So et al. 2024).
 *
 * Research Basis:
 * - Replicated across 50+ cultures with 85%+ consistency
 * - Predicts mental health outcomes, life satisfaction, coping strategies
 * - Stable classification with 73% test-retest reliability over 2 years
 *
 * @see https://doi.org/10.1111/jopy.12884 (2024 validation)
 * @see Block, J. H., & Block, J. (1980). The role of ego-control and ego-resiliency
