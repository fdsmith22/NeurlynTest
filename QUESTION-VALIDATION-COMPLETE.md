### 3. Question Wording Analysis ‚úÖ PASSED

**Script:** `scripts/analyze-question-wording.js`

**Initial Result:** 12 questions flagged for review (out of 591)
**After Fixes:** 10 questions flagged (5 sensitive content using validated scales, 5 minor improvements)
**Stigmatizing Language:** 0 (2 terms fixed using `scripts/fix-stigmatizing-language.js`)

#### High Severity - Sensitive Content (5 questions)

These questions use validated clinical scale wording and should remain as-is to maintain psychometric validity:

**Suicide Screening (4 questions):**
1. **SUICIDE_SCREEN_3** - "I have had thoughts about ways I might hurt or **kill myself**."
   - üí° Optional: Change "kill myself" ‚Üí "end my life" (softer)
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This is PHQ-9 Item 9 validated wording - changes may affect validity

2. **SUICIDE_SCREEN_4** - "I have made a specific plan for how I would end my life."
   - ‚úÖ Already uses gentle phrasing ("end my life")

3. **SUICIDE_SCREEN_5** - "I have intentionally hurt myself without intending to die (such as **cutting**, burning, or hitting myself)."
   - ‚úÖ Appropriate clinical examples - validated Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale wording

4. **SUICIDE_SCREEN_6** - "I have attempted to end my life in the past."
   - ‚úÖ Already uses gentle phrasing ("end my life")

**Borderline (1 question):**
5. **BORDERLINE_IMPULSIVE_2** - "I have made suicide attempts or engaged in **self-harming** behavior (such as **cutting** or burning)"
   - ‚úÖ Appropriate MSI-BPD validated wording - direct language necessary

#### Low Severity - Minor Improvements (5 questions)

1. **DEPRESSION_PHQ9_8** - Very long (203 chars)
   - Current: "Over the past two weeks, how often have you moved or spoken so slowly that other people could have noticed? Or the opposite‚Äîbeing so fidgety or restless that you have been moving around a lot more than usual?"
   - üí° Suggestion: Split into two separate questions OR keep as-is (this is validated PHQ-9 wording)

2. **ANXIETY_PANIC_2** - Uses "symptom" (medical term)
   - Current: "When you experience these symptoms..."
   - üí° Suggestion: "When you experience these feelings..." (softer)

3. **ANXIETY_SOCIAL_5** - Uses "symptom" (medical term)
   - Current: "...notice my anxiety symptoms"
   - üí° Suggestion: "...notice my anxiety" (softer)

4. **BORDERLINE_DISSOCIATION_1** - Uses "paranoid" (clinical term)
   - Current: "...paranoid thoughts or dissociative symptoms"
   - üí° Suggestion: "...strong suspicions that others are against you, or feeling detached from reality" (gentler)

5. **VALIDITY_INFREQ_3** - Uses "hallucinations" (clinical term)
   - Current: "I have frequent hallucinations"
   - ‚úÖ This is a validity check question - clinical term appropriate
