## Implementation Tasks

### Task 1: No Schema Updates Needed
Existing schema supports all Phase 3 categories:
- `personality` (for interpersonal functioning)
- `clinical_psychopathology` (for borderline, somatic)
- `attachment` (for expanded attachment)

New subcategories to use:
- `resilience_coping`
- `interpersonal_circumplex`
- `borderline_features`
- `somatic_symptoms`
- `treatment_indicators`

### Task 2: Question Creation

1. 15-20 Resilience & Coping questions
2. 15-20 Expanded Interpersonal Functioning questions
3. 12-15 Borderline Features questions
4. 10-12 Somatic Symptom questions
5. 12-15 Treatment Indicator questions

**Total:** 64-82 new questions

### Task 3: Scoring Services
Create new scoring modules:

#### A. `services/resilience-scorer.js`
- Resilience total score
- Adaptive vs maladaptive coping ratio
- Protective factors assessment
- Coping strategy recommendations

#### B. `services/interpersonal-scorer.js`
- Attachment style classification (secure, anxious, avoidant, disorganized)
- Interpersonal circumplex octant scores
- Relationship quality index
- Interpersonal problem areas

#### C. `services/borderline-scorer.js`

3. `borderline_screening` - Triggered by emotional dysregulation + relationship instability
4. `somatic_symptoms` - Triggered by high neuroticism or health concerns
5. `treatment_planning` - Always allocate some (planning indicators)

Update trigger logic:
- Borderline triggers: High emotional dysregulation + high neuroticism + low agreeableness
- Somatic triggers: High neuroticism + physical health concerns
- Always allocate resilience and treatment indicators

### Task 5: Documentation
Create comprehensive documentation:
- `PHASE-3-IMPLEMENTATION-COMPLETE.md`
- Final system architecture summary

## Quality Assurance

### Clinical Validation
- CD-RISC (Resilience): Validated across multiple populations

- IIP-32 (Interpersonal): Well-validated circumplex model
- MSI-BPD: 81% sensitivity, 85% specificity for BPD
- PHQ-15: Standard somatic symptom screening
- MSPSS (Social Support): Excellent psychometric properties

### Safety Considerations
1. **Borderline screening** - Appropriate referrals for positive screens
2. **Aggression risk** - Safety planning if indicated
3. **Low social support + high stressors** - Crisis resource provision
4. **Somatic symptoms** - Medical evaluation recommendation
