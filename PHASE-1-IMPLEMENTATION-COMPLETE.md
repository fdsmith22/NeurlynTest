## 🏗️ Architecture Changes

### 1. Schema Updates ✅
**File:** `models/QuestionBank.js`

Added new categories to support clinical assessment:
- `clinical_psychopathology` - Depression, anxiety, substance use, etc.
- `validity_scales` - Response quality detection

### 2. New Services Created ✅

#### ValidityScaleCalculator (`services/validity-scale-calculator.js`)
**Purpose:** Detect invalid response patterns
- **Inconsistency Detection:** 10 question pairs to detect contradictory responses
- **Infrequency Detection:** 6 rarely-endorsed items to detect exaggeration
- **Positive Impression Detection:** 8 items to detect "faking good"
- **Random Responding Detection:** Combined heuristics
- **Output:** Validity report with reliability rating (INVALID, QUESTIONABLE, CAUTION, ACCEPTABLE, GOOD)

#### DepressionScorer (`services/depression-scorer.js`)
**Purpose:** Calculate depression severity
- **PHQ-9 Scoring:** Official 0-27 scale with severity categories
  - None (0-4), Mild (5-9), Moderate (10-14), Moderately Severe (15-19), Severe (20-27)
- **Suicidal Ideation Detection:** Item 9 tracking with severity levels
- **Clinical Indicators:** 9 additional depression markers
- **Alerts:** Critical alerts for severe depression/suicidal ideation
- **Recommendations:** Severity-appropriate clinical recommendations

#### AnxietyScorer (`services/anxiety-scorer.js`)
**Purpose:** Calculate anxiety severity and identify subtypes
- **GAD-7 Scoring:** Official 0-21 scale with severity categories
  - Minimal (0-4), Mild (5-9), Moderate (10-14), Severe (15-21)
- **Panic Disorder Screening:** 5-item assessment
- **Social Anxiety Screening:** 5-item assessment
- **OCD Screening:** 4-item assessment
- **PTSD Screening:** 3-item assessment
- **Primary Type Detection:** Identifies dominant anxiety presentation
- **Type-Specific Recommendations:** CBT, ERP, EMDR, etc.

### 3. Adaptive Selector Enhancement ✅
**File:** `services/comprehensive-adaptive-selector.js`

#### Added 8 Clinical Pathways:
1. **depression_clinical** - Depression assessment (max 15 questions)
2. **suicidal_ideation** - Suicide risk screening (max 7 questions, highest priority)
3. **anxiety_gad** - Generalized anxiety (max 10 questions)
4. **anxiety_panic** - Panic disorder (max 6 questions)
5. **anxiety_social** - Social anxiety (max 6 questions)
6. **anxiety_ocd** - OCD screening (max 5 questions)
7. **anxiety_ptsd** - PTSD screening (max 5 questions)
8. **substance_screening** - Alcohol/drug use (max 10 questions)

#### Enhanced Trigger Logic:
- **Clinical Baseline Integration:** Uses baseline screening responses to activate pathways
- **Internalizing Dimension:** Depression + anxiety pathways activated together
- **Externalizing Dimension:** Substance use + low conscientiousness
- **Anxiety Subtyping:** Automatically determines panic, social, OCD, PTSD based on profile
- **Priority-Based Allocation:** Clinical pathways get priority when triggered

#### Pathway Activation Examples:
```javascript
// Depression activated if:
- neuroticism >= 3.5 OR
- baseline depression screening >= 4

// Panic activated if:
- anxiety_indicators TRUE AND
- neuroticism >= 4.0

// Substance activated if:
- conscientiousness <= 2.5 OR
- baseline substance screening >= 3
```

## 🔬 Technical Implementation Details

### Validity Scale Methodology

**Inconsistency Pairs (MMPI-3 approach):**
```javascript
['VALIDITY_INCONS_1A', 'VALIDITY_INCONS_1B']  // Calmness
['VALIDITY_INCONS_2A', 'VALIDITY_INCONS_2B']  // Social preference
// ... 10 pairs total
```
- Flag if >30% of pairs show difference < 2 points (on 1-5 scale)
- Critical if combined with low response variance (random responding)

**Infrequency Items:**
- Statements rarely endorsed in normal population (<5%)
- Examples: "I have never felt sad", "I can read minds"
- Flag if >40% endorsed

**Positive Impression:**
- "Too good to be true" statements
- Examples: "I never get angry", "I always tell the truth"
- Flag if >50% endorsed

### Depression Scoring Algorithm

**PHQ-9 Calculation:**
```javascript
// Response mapping (0-3 per item)
"Not at all" = 0
"Several days" = 1
"More than half the days" = 2
"Nearly every day" = 3

// Total: Sum of 9 items (0-27)
// Severity: Based on validated cut-points
```

**Suicidal Ideation (Item 9):**
- Score 0: No risk
- Score 1-2: Moderate concern, safety planning
- Score 3: High risk, immediate intervention

### Anxiety Scoring Algorithm

**GAD-7 Calculation:**
```javascript
// Same 0-3 mapping as PHQ-9
// Total: 0-21
// Cut-points: 5, 10, 15 for mild, moderate, severe
```

**Subtype Determination:**
- Calculate all subscale averages (panic, social, OCD, PTSD)
- Identify highest average as primary type
- Include in report for targeted treatment recommendations

### Adaptive Pathway Integration

**Clinical Trigger Logic:**
```javascript
// Check baseline screening
const depressionScreen = baselineResponses.find(r =>
  r.questionId === 'BASELINE_CLINICAL_DEPRESSION'
);

// Activate if personality OR baseline indicates concern
if (neuroticism >= 3.5 || depressionScreen?.score >= 4) {
  triggers.add('depression_indicators');
  triggers.add('internalizing_pathway');
}
```

**Pathway Priority Calculation:**
```javascript
priorities.depression_clinical =
  triggers.has('depression_indicators') ? 9 : 1;
priorities.suicidal_ideation =
  triggers.has('suicidal_risk') ? 10 : 0;  // Highest priority
```

**Allocation Strategy:**
```javascript
depression_clinical: { min: 0, max: 15, triggerScore: 3.5 }
anxiety_gad: { min: 0, max: 10, triggerScore: 3.5 }
substance_screening: { min: 0, max: 10, triggerScore: 2.5 }
```

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Example 1: High Depression Profile

**Baseline Responses:**
- Neuroticism: 4.5
- Depression screening: Score 5 (Strongly Agree)

**Triggers Activated:**
- `depression_indicators`
- `internalizing_pathway`
- `suicidal_risk` (if neuroticism >= 4.5)

**Pathways Selected:**
- `depression_clinical`: 12-15 questions (PHQ-9 + clinical)
- `suicidal_ideation`: 5-7 questions
- `anxiety_gad`: 7-10 questions (co-morbid)
- `personality_facets`: 5 questions (reduced)

**Scoring Output:**
```javascript
{
  depression: {
    phq9Total: 18,
    severity: "Moderately Severe",
    suicidalIdeation: { detected: true, severity: "Moderate" }
  },
  recommendations: [
    "Seek evaluation from mental health professional",
    "Evidence-based treatments include therapy (CBT, IPT) and/or medication",
    "IMPORTANT: Suicidal thoughts detected - seek immediate support",
    "National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 988"
  ]
}
```

### Example 2: High Anxiety Profile

**Baseline Responses:**
- Neuroticism: 4.0
- Extraversion: 2.0
- Anxiety screening: Score 5

**Triggers Activated:**
- `anxiety_indicators`
- `social_anxiety_indicators` (low extraversion)
- `internalizing_pathway`

**Pathways Selected:**
- `anxiety_gad`: 7 questions (GAD-7)
- `anxiety_social`: 5 questions
- `anxiety_panic`: 4 questions (high neuroticism)
- `depression_clinical`: 8 questions (internalizing)

**Scoring Output:**
```javascript
{
  anxiety: {
    gad7Total: 16,
    severity: "Severe",
    primaryType: "Social Anxiety",
    socialAnxietyAvg: 4.2
  },
  recommendations: [
    "Seek evaluation from mental health professional",
    "Evidence-based treatments include CBT, exposure therapy",
    "For social anxiety: Cognitive restructuring and gradual exposure to social situations"
  ]
}
```

### Example 3: Invalid Response Pattern

**Validity Detection:**
- Inconsistency: 40% of pairs (HIGH)
- Standard deviation: 0.3 (very low variance)
- Pattern: All responses = 3 (Neutral)

**Validity Output:**
```javascript
{
  valid: false,
  reliability: "INVALID",
  flags: [
    {
      type: "RANDOM_RESPONDING",
      severity: "CRITICAL",
      message: "Response pattern suggests random or careless responding"
    }
  ],
  recommendation: "Results are likely invalid and should not be used for clinical decision-making. Consider re-administration with clear instructions."
}
```
