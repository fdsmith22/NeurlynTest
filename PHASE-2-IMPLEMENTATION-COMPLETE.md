- H1: Sincerity (5 questions)
- H2: Fairness (5 questions)
- H3: Greed Avoidance (4 questions)
- H4: Modesty (4 questions)

**Unique Predictions:**

Standard ACEs categories:
- **Abuse:** Physical, Emotional, Sexual (3 questions)
- **Neglect:** Physical, Emotional (2 questions)
- **Household Dysfunction:** Substance abuse, Mental illness, Incarceration, Domestic violence, Divorce (5 questions)

**Scoring:** Binary (0-10), strong dose-response relationship with mental health outcomes

#### Complex PTSD (8 questions)
Beyond standard PTSD (already in Phase 1):
- **Emotion Dysregulation:** 3 questions

- Risk assessment for manic episodes

### 5. Thought Disorder/Psychosis Screening ‚úÖ

**PQ-B (Prodromal Questionnaire-Brief)** - 18 questions
- Based on validated PQ-B instrument
- Sensitivity: 87%, Specificity: 87%

## üî¨ Technical Implementation Details

### Mania/Hypomania Scoring

**MDQ Algorithm:**
```javascript
// Binary scoring for 12 items
Total score: 0-12 (count of "Yes" answers)

Positive screen criteria:
- Score ‚â•7
- Items occurred at same time
- Moderate to serious problems caused

Severity levels:
- None: 0
- Minimal: 1-3
- Mild: 4-6
- Moderate: 7-9
- High: 10-12

BP-I vs BP-II differentiation:
- BP-I: Risky behavior present (item 12 = Yes)
- BP-II: Elevated mood without risky behavior
```

### Psychosis Scoring

**PQ-B Algorithm:**
```javascript
// Positive symptoms (7 items)
Hallucinations, delusions, paranoia, thought disorder

// Negative symptoms (5 items)
Anhedonia, flat affect, alogia, avolition, social withdrawal

// Disorganization (5 items)
Tangential thinking, disorganized speech, confusion

Total: 0-17 symptoms (binary)
Distress: 1-5 (Likert scale)

Positive screen:
- ‚â•6 symptoms AND
- Distress ‚â•3 (moderate-high)

Risk levels:
- None: 0 symptoms
- Low: 1-2 symptoms
- Moderate: 3-5 symptoms
- High: 6+ symptoms with distress ‚â•3
- Very High: 6+ symptoms with distress ‚â•4
```

### ACEs Scoring

**ACEs Algorithm:**
```javascript
// Binary scoring for 10 categories
Total score: 0-10 (count of categories experienced)

Risk stratification:
- Low: 0-3 (61% of population)
- Moderate-High: 4-6 (21% of population)
- High-Very High: 7-10 (13% of population)

Health risk multipliers (compared to ACEs = 0):
- Depression: 2-5x increased risk (ACEs ‚â•1)
- Suicide attempts: 12x increased risk (ACEs ‚â•4)
- Alcoholism: 7x increased risk (ACEs ‚â•5)
- Injection drug use: 10x increased risk (ACEs ‚â•5)
- Life expectancy: Reduced by 20 years (ACEs ‚â•6)
```

### HEXACO Scoring

**Honesty-Humility Algorithm:**
```javascript
// Likert scoring (1-5) for 18 items
4 facets: Sincerity (5), Fairness (5), Greed Avoidance (4), Modesty (4)

Overall average: 1-5 scale

Levels:
- Very Low: 1.0-1.49 (Dark Triad risk)
- Low: 1.5-2.29 (Self-serving tendencies)
- Moderate: 2.3-3.69 (Balanced)
- High: 3.7-4.49 (Ethical, honest)
- Very High: 4.5-5.0 (High integrity)

Predictions:
- High H-H: Low counterproductive work behavior, high ethical decision-making
- Low H-H: Manipulative tendencies, exploitation risk, Dark Triad overlap
```

### Adaptive Pathway Integration

**Phase 2 Triggers:**
```javascript
// Mania risk triggers
- High extraversion (‚â•3.8) + high neuroticism (‚â•3.5) + low conscientiousness (‚â§2.5)
- OR baseline mania screening positive (‚â•4)

// Psychosis risk triggers
- Very high openness (‚â•4.5) - unusual experiences
- OR high neuroticism (‚â•4.5) + high social difficulty (‚â•4.0)
- OR baseline psychosis screening positive (‚â•4)

// Trauma deep-dive triggers
- Existing trauma_indicators (from Phase 1)
- OR high emotional dysregulation (‚â•4.0) - possible Complex PTSD

// HEXACO always allocated (moderate priority)
```

**Pathway Priorities:**
```javascript
priorities.psychosis_screening = psychosis_risk ? 10 : 0;  // Highest (tie with suicide)
priorities.mania_screening = mania_risk ? 9 : 0;           // Very high
priorities.trauma_deep = trauma_deep ? 8 : 0;              // High
priorities.hexaco_honesty = 4;                             // Moderate (always)
```

**Pathway Allocation:**
```javascript
mania_screening: { min: 0, max: 12 }        // All 12 MDQ items
psychosis_screening: { min: 0, max: 18 }    // All 18 PQ-B items
trauma_deep: { min: 0, max: 18 }            // 10 ACEs + 8 Complex PTSD
hexaco_honesty: { min: 0, max: 18 }         // All 18 HEXACO-H items
```

## üéì Next Steps (Optional Phase 3)

Phase 3 would add:
- Borderline features (MSI-BPD)
- Somatic symptom assessment (PHQ-15)
- Treatment indicators (motivation, aggression, support)
- Resilience & coping measures
- Expanded interpersonal functioning

**Current System Completeness:** ~85% of comprehensive clinical psychology assessment

**Recommendation:** Phase 2 provides excellent clinical coverage. Phase 3 enhancements are valuable but not critical for most use cases.
