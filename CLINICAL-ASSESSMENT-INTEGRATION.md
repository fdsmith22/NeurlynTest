## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Accessing Clinical Data in Report

```javascript
const report = await reportGenerator.generateReport(assessmentData);

// Access top-level clinical assessment
const clinical = report.clinical;

// Access specific assessments
const maniaScreening = clinical.mania;
const borderlineScreening = clinical.borderline;
const resilienceScores = clinical.resilience;

// Check for critical alerts
const criticalAlerts = clinical.alerts.filter(a => a.severity === 'CRITICAL');

if (criticalAlerts.length > 0) {
  console.log('CRITICAL ALERTS:', criticalAlerts);
  // Take immediate action (notify clinician, display warning, etc.)
}

// Access clinical summary
const clinicalSummary = clinical.summary;
```

### Example 2: Borderline Positive Screen

**Input:** Assessment with high emotional dysregulation + relationship instability

**Clinical Output:**
```javascript
{
  clinical: {
    borderline: {
      scores: {
        totalCriteria: 8,
        positiveScreen: true,
        screeningLevel: 'Positive (High Probability BPD)',
        domains: {

      },
      summary: 'MSI-BPD Screening: Positive (High Probability BPD). 8/9 DSM-5 criteria met. POSITIVE SCREEN: High probability of Borderline Personality Disorder. Comprehensive clinical evaluation recommended.',
      recommendations: [
        'IMMEDIATE: Seek comprehensive psychiatric evaluation for BPD assessment',
        'CRITICAL: If experiencing suicidal thoughts or self-harm urges, contact crisis services immediately',
        'Consider specialized BPD treatment (DBT, MBT, or TFP)',
        'DBT (Dialectical Behavior Therapy) is gold-standard treatment for BPD',
        'Build crisis coping plan with mental health professional'
      ]
    },
    alerts: [
      {
        severity: 'HIGH',

      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Example 3: Treatment Planning Indicators

  clinical: {
    treatmentIndicators: {
      scores: {
        motivation: {
          overall: {

        recommendations: [...]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Unit Testing

Test each clinical scorer independently:

```javascript
// Test Borderline Scorer
const BorderlineScorer = require('./services/borderline-scorer');

const mockResponses = [
  { questionId: 'BORDERLINE_EMOTIONAL_1', score: 5 },
  { questionId: 'BORDERLINE_EMOTIONAL_2', score: 5 },
  // ... all borderline responses
];

const scorer = new BorderlineScorer(mockResponses);
const results = scorer.calculate();

console.log('Borderline Results:', results);
// Verify: totalCriteria, positiveScreen, recommendations
```

### 2. Integration Testing

Test full report generation with clinical assessment:

```javascript
const ComprehensiveReportGenerator = require('./services/comprehensive-report-generator');

const reportGenerator = new ComprehensiveReportGenerator();

const testAssessment = {
  responses: [...], // 80 comprehensive assessment responses
  tier: 'comprehensive',
  duration: 1200,
  metadata: { age: 28, gender: 'Female' }
};

const report = await reportGenerator.generateReport(testAssessment);

console.log('Clinical Assessment:', report.clinical);
console.log('Clinical Alerts:', report.clinical.alerts);

// Verify all 9 scorers ran
assert(report.clinical.mania, 'Mania scorer ran');
assert(report.clinical.borderline, 'Borderline scorer ran');
assert(report.clinical.resilience, 'Resilience scorer ran');
// ... etc
```

### 3. Alert System Testing

Test that alerts are generated correctly for positive screens:

```javascript
// Create borderline positive screen responses
const borderlinePositiveResponses = [
  // 8+ criteria met (high scores on borderline questions)
];

const report = await reportGenerator.generateReport({ responses: borderlinePositiveResponses, tier: 'comprehensive' });

const borderlineAlert = report.clinical.alerts.find(a => a.domain === 'Borderline Personality Disorder');

assert(borderlineAlert !== undefined, 'Borderline alert generated');
assert(borderlineAlert.severity === 'HIGH', 'Severity is HIGH');
assert(borderlineAlert.recommendations.length > 0, 'Recommendations provided');
```

## Performance Considerations

### Computational Cost

- **9 additional scorers** run per comprehensive assessment
- Each scorer processes ~2-20 questions
- Total added computation: ~50-100ms per report

### Optimization Strategies (Future)

1. **Lazy Loading**: Only run scorers if relevant questions were asked
2. **Parallel Execution**: Run scorers in parallel using Promise.all()
3. **Caching**: Cache scorer results for repeated report requests
4. **Conditional Scoring**: Skip scorers based on baseline responses

Example conditional optimization:

```javascript
// Only run borderline scorer if borderline pathway was allocated
if (hasPathway(responses, 'borderline_screening')) {
  const borderlineScorer = new BorderlineScorer(responses);
  clinical.borderline = borderlineScorer.calculate();
}
```

---

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Clinical Decision Support

Add treatment recommendation engine based on clinical assessment:

```javascript
{
  clinical: {
    // ... existing assessments ...
    treatmentPlan: {
      primaryDiagnosis: 'Borderline Personality Disorder',
      secondaryDiagnoses: ['Major Depressive Disorder', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder'],
      recommendedTreatments: [
        { modality: 'DBT', priority: 'High', evidence: 'Strong' },
        { modality: 'Medication (SSRI)', priority: 'Moderate', evidence: 'Moderate' }
      ],
      prognosticFactors: {
        favorable: ['High motivation', 'Strong social support'],
        unfavorable: ['High ACEs score', 'Low conscientiousness']
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Longitudinal Tracking

Track clinical scores over time for progress monitoring:

```javascript
{
  clinical: {
    // ... current assessment ...
    longitudinal: {
      baseline: { date: '2025-01-01', phq15: 18, resilienceScore: 2.3 },
      month3: { date: '2025-04-01', phq15: 12, resilienceScore: 3.1 },
      current: { date: '2025-10-06', phq15: 8, resilienceScore: 3.8 },
      trends: {
        improving: ['resilience', 'somatic_symptoms'],
        stable: ['attachment_style'],
        worsening: []
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Risk Scoring

Aggregate risk scores across all clinical domains:

```javascript
{
  clinical: {
    // ... existing assessments ...
    riskProfile: {
      overall: 'MODERATE-HIGH',
      domains: {
        psychosis: 'LOW',
        bipolar: 'HIGH',
        borderline: 'HIGH',
        substance: 'LOW',
        suicide: 'MODERATE',
        aggression: 'MODERATE'
      },
      interventions: [
        { risk: 'bipolar', action: 'Psychiatric evaluation (urgent)', timeline: 'Within 1 week' },
        { risk: 'borderline', action: 'DBT referral', timeline: 'Within 2 weeks' }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Clinical Validation

All integrated scorers use validated clinical instruments:

| Instrument | Validation | Sensitivity | Specificity | PPV/NPV |
|------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| **MDQ** | Bipolar screening | 73% | 90% | PPV varies by base rate |
| **PQ-B** | Psychosis risk | 87% | 87% | PPV 0.27 in general population |
| **MSI-BPD** | Borderline screening | 81% | 85% | PPV 0.74 (≥7 criteria) |
| **PHQ-15** | Somatic symptoms | α = .80 | Correlates with functional impairment | N/A (dimensional) |
| **CD-RISC** | Resilience | α = .89 | Predicts PTSD recovery | N/A (dimensional) |
| **ECR-R** | Attachment | α > .90 | Gold-standard measure | N/A (dimensional) |
| **IIP-32** | Interpersonal problems | Well-validated circumplex | N/A (dimensional) | N/A |
| **MSPSS** | Social support | α = .88 | Predicts mental health outcomes | N/A (dimensional) |
| **ACEs** | Childhood adversity | Dose-response with health outcomes | Retrospective measure | N/A (dimensional) |
