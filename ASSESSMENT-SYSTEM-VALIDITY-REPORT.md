## Facet Intelligence System

### Architecture

**File:** `services/facet-intelligence.js`

**Key Components:**
1. **NEO Facet Definitions** - Complete mapping of 30 facets (6 per Big Five trait)
2. **Cross-Trait Correlation Matrix** - Evidence-based rules for facet prioritization
3. **Boost/Suppress Logic** - Context-aware facet selection
4. **Allocation Calculator** - Extremity-based question distribution

### Cross-Trait Correlation Rules (Sample)

```javascript
neuroticism: {
  anxiety: {
    boostIf: [
      { trait: 'neuroticism', subIndicator: 'emotional_regulation',
        operator: '>', value: 3.5, boost: 6 },  // Emotional dysreg → anxiety
      { trait: 'conscientiousness', operator: '<', value: 3.5, boost: 3 },  // Low C → anxiety
      { trait: 'extraversion', operator: '<', value: 2.5, boost: 3 }  // Introversion → social anxiety
    ]
  },
  angry_hostility: {
    boostIf: [
      { trait: 'agreeableness', operator: '<', value: 2.5, boost: 4 }  // Low A → anger
    ],
    suppressIf: [
      { trait: 'agreeableness', operator: '>=', value: 3.0, suppress: 4 },  // Medium-High A → less anger
      { trait: 'neuroticism', subIndicator: 'emotional_regulation',
        operator: '>', value: 3.5, suppress: 3 }  // Emotional dysreg is anxiety, not anger
    ]
  }
}
```

### Enhanced Allocation Strategy

**Before:**
- Even distribution: 3-4 questions per trait
- No consideration of trait extremity
- Random facet selection

**After:**
- Extremity-based allocation:
  - Very extreme (|score - 3| ≥ 1.5): 30% of allocation (5-6 questions)
  - Extreme (|score - 3| ≥ 1.0): 25% of allocation (4-5 questions)
  - Moderate (|score - 3| ≥ 0.5): 20% of allocation (3-4 questions)
  - Neutral (|score - 3| < 0.5): 15% of allocation (2-3 questions)

**Facet Diversity:**
- Maximum questions per facet: `floor(allocation / 3)`
- For 5 questions: max 1-2 per facet → ensures 3+ facets covered
- For 6 questions: max 2 per facet → ensures 3+ facets covered
