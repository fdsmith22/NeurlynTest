## Summary

The integration now includes two phases of research-based enhancements:

**Phase 1**: Deep psychological assessment capabilities with clinical standards (NEO-PI-R, DSM-5, GAD-7, PHQ-9, etc.)

**Phase 2**: Advanced theoretical frameworks providing deeper insights into attachment, cognitive processing, emotional intelligence, stress responses, decision-making, motivation, flow states, values, creativity, and social intelligence.

The system now provides comprehensive, scientifically-grounded insights that help users understand not just their personality traits, but also their attachment patterns, cognitive styles, emotional capabilities, stress responses, decision-making approaches, motivational drivers, creative potential, and social intelligence - all integrated with their Big Five personality profile for personalized, actionable insights.
